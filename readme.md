# Requirements
`pip3 install pygame`

# Run
`python3 main.py`

# Notes
1. The Red Square is UE
2. Blue Square is the eNB
3. The Purple square is the MME Gateway

Move the red square to trigger a Handover process.
If during the HO, the UE moves too far aways from the eNB such that signal is very low, in that case the HO fails.

This tool can be used for education purposes, to explain the entire HO in interactive way.
